## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Key Functions:**
- `processAbsentStudents()` ‚Üí **Automatically opens photo verification modal**
- `toggleAttendanceStatus(photoId)` ‚Üí **Click to cycle attendance states**
- `saveAttendance()` ‚Üí **Creates final attendance records**
- `cleanupProcessedPhotos()` ‚Üí **Removes temporary photos**

### **Database Structure:**

#### **During QR Session (Temporary):**
```javascript
// tempPhotos collection
{
  studentId: "user_id",
  photoData: "data:image/jpeg;base64,...", // Temporary only
  status: "pending_verification",
  qrSessionId: "session_id",
  date: "2025-09-16",
  // ... other student data
}
```

#### **After Faculty Save (Permanent):**
```javascript
// attendances collection
{
  userId: "user_id",
  studentName: "Student Name",
  status: "present",
  hasPhoto: false, // Photos NOT stored permanently
  photoVerified: true, // But verification confirmed
  verificationNotes: "Photo verified by faculty but not stored permanently"
  // ... other attendance data
  // NOTE: NO photoData field - photos are deleted
}
```
