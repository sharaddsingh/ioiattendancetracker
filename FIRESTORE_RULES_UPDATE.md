# Firestore Rules Update - Comprehensive Security Rules

## Overview
The Firestore security rules have been completely overhauled to support all the functionality required by the Student Attendance and Leave Management System. The new rules provide proper access control while enabling all features to work correctly.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. **Individual Student Report Error**
**Problem**: Faculty members were getting "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors when generating individual student reports.

**Solution**: Added rules allowing faculty to read attendance records for all students, not just their own:
```javascript
// Faculty can read all attendance records for reports and manual entry verification
allow read: if isFaculty();
```

### 2. **Manual Attendance Entry**
**Problem**: Faculty couldn't load student lists or submit manual attendance.

**Solution**: Added permissions for faculty to:
- Read all user profiles and documents
- Create attendance records for students
- Read student information for batch loading

### 3. **Leave Request Management**
**Problem**: Faculty couldn't see or process leave requests.

**Solution**: Enhanced leave request rules:
```javascript
// Faculty can read and update leave requests for approval/rejection
allow read, update: if isFaculty();
```

### 4. **QR Code Functionality**
**Problem**: QR scanning and photo verification weren't working properly.

**Solution**: Added support for:
- Students creating their own attendance records via QR scan
- Faculty creating QR sessions with daily schedule tracking

## New Rule Structure

### Helper Functions
- `isAuthenticated()` - Checks if user is logged in
- `isFaculty()` - Checks if user exists in faculty collection
- `isStudent()` - Checks if user exists in profiles or has student role

### Collection-Specific Rules

#### **Users Collection**
- Users can read/write their own documents
- **Faculty can read all user documents** (for reports and manual attendance)

#### **Profiles Collection**
- Users can read/write their own profiles
- **Faculty can read all profiles** (for student management and reports)

#### **Faculty Collection**
- Faculty can read/write their own documents
- Faculty can read other faculty documents (for name resolution in reports)

#### **Attendances Collection**
- Students can read their own attendance records
- Students can create their own attendance (QR scanning)
- **Faculty can read ALL attendance records** (for reports)
- **Faculty can create attendance records** (manual entry)
- Faculty can update records they created

#### **Leave Requests Collection**
- Students can create their own leave requests
- Students can read their own leave requests
- **Faculty can read and update ALL leave requests**

#### **Notifications Collection**
- Users can read their own notifications
- Users can update their own notifications (mark as read)
- **Faculty can create notifications** (leave status updates)

#### **Daily Schedules Collection**
- **Faculty can read and write** (for QR session period tracking)

## Security Features Maintained

1. **User Isolation**: Students can still only access their own data
2. **Faculty Authorization**: All faculty permissions require existing faculty document
3. **Ownership Validation**: Users can only modify their own profiles and settings
4. **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for different user types

## Testing Collections
- Added `test` collection for debugging with authenticated user access
- Maintains security while allowing troubleshooting

## Deployment Status
✅ **Successfully deployed and cleaned** to Firebase project `attendancetracker-f8461`

### Final Rules Version:
- **Compilation**: ✅ Clean compilation with no errors or warnings
- **Syntax**: ✅ Optimized and properly formatted
- **Security**: ✅ Maintains proper security boundaries
- **Functionality**: ✅ Supports all project features

## Expected Functionality Now Working

1. ✅ **Individual Student Reports** - Faculty can query any student's attendance
2. ✅ **Batch Reports** - Faculty can generate batch-wise attendance reports  
3. ✅ **Manual Attendance Entry** - Faculty can load students and mark attendance
4. ✅ **Leave Request Processing** - Faculty can approve/reject leave requests
5. ✅ **QR Code Generation** - Faculty can create QR codes with period tracking
6. ✅ **Student QR Scanning** - Students can scan QR codes and mark attendance
7. ✅ **Photo Verification** - Photo capture and storage during QR attendance
8. ✅ **Notification System** - Leave status notifications work properly
9. ✅ **Profile Management** - Both student and faculty profile completion
10. ✅ **Daily Schedule Tracking** - Prevents exceeding 4 periods per day

## Notes for Development

- Rules are designed to be permissive enough for all functionality while maintaining security
- Faculty access is gated behind the `isFaculty()` function which checks for faculty document existence
- The rules support both the current data structure and provide flexibility for future enhancements
- Error handling is improved with proper permission structure

The "Missing or insufficient permissions" error should now be resolved across all features.
